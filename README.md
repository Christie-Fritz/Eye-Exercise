# Eye-Exercise
In this project, I created eyes that will follow the mouse when the mouse cursor is on the screen.

## How to View
> Click on the green "code" button and download the zip file
>> Extract the file
>>> Drag the HTML file to a new browser
>>>> Refresh page
>>>>> Move the mouse on the screen and watch as the eye balls follow.

### Changes to come
Change the style of the eyes and create an animation face.
